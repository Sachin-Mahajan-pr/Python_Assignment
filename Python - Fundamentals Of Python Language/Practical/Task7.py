# Practical Example: 1) Write a Python program to print "Hello" using a string.
# s = "Hello"
# print(s)
# Practical Example: 2) Write a Python program to allocate a string to a variable and print it.
# s = "Welcome to Python"
# print(s)
# Practical Example: 3) Write a Python program to print a string using triple quotes.
# s = """This is a string 
# written using 
# triple quotes."""
# print(s)
# Practical Example: 4) Write a Python program to access the first character of a string using
# index value.
# s = "Python"
# print(s[0])
# Practical Example: 5) Write a Python program to access the string from the second position
# onwards using slicing.
# s = "Python"
# print(s[1:])
# Practical Example: 6) Write a Python program to access a string up to the fifth character.
# s = "Python Programming"
# print(s[:5])
# Practical Example: 7) Write a Python program to print the substring between index values 1
# and 4.
# s = "Python"
# print(s[1:4])
# # Practical Example: 8) Write a Python program to print a string from the last character.
# s = "Python"
# print(s[-1])
# Practical Example: 9) Write a Python program to print every alternate character from the
# string starting from index 1.
s = "PythonProgramming"
print(s[1::2])
