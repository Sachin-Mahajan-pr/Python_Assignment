# Write a Python program to access values between index 1 and 5 in a tuple
# my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)
# print(my_tuple[1:6])

#  Write a Python program to access alternate values between index 1 and 5 in a tuple
# my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)
# print(my_tuple[1:6:2])

# Practical Example

#  Write a Python program to access values between index 1 and 5 in
# a tuple. 
# my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
# print(my_tuple[1:6])

# Write a Python program to access the value from the last index in a tuple.

my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(my_tuple[-1])
