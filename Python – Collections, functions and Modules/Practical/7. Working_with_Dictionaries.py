# Write a Python program to update a value in a dictionary
# my_dict = {"name": "Bhautik", "age": 22, "city": "Surat"}
# my_dict["age"] = 23
# print(my_dict)

# Write a Python program to merge two lists into one dictionary using a loop
# keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
# values = ["Bhautik", 22, "Surat"]
# my_dict = {}
# for i in range(len(keys)):
#     my_dict[keys[i]] = values[i]
# print(my_dict)

# Practical Example
# Write a Python program to update a value at a particular key in a
# dictionary
# my_dict = {"name": "Bhautik", "age": 22, "city": "Surat"}
# my_dict["city"] = "Ahmedabad"
# print(my_dict)

#  Write a Python program to separate keys and values from a dictionary using
# keys() and values() methods

# my_dict = {"name": "Bhautik", "age": 22, "city": "Surat"}
# keys = my_dict.keys()
# values = my_dict.values()
# print(keys)
# print(values)

#  Write a Python program to convert two lists into one
# dictionary using a for loop
# keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
# values = ["Bhautik", 22, "Surat"]
# my_dict = {}
# for i in range(len(keys)):
#     my_dict[keys[i]] = values[i]
# print(my_dict)

# Write a Python program to count how many times each
# character appears in a string.
# text = "pythonprogramming"
# count = {}
# for char in text:
#     if char in count:
#         count[char] += 1
#     else:
#         count[char] = 1
# print(count)
