#  Write a Python program to create a tuple with multiple data types.
# my_tuple = (10, "Python", 3.14, True, 25)
# print(my_tuple)

# Write a Python program to concatenate two tuples.
# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30)
# tuple2 = (40, 50, 60)
# result = tuple1 + tuple2
# print(result)

# Practical Example
# Write a Python program to convert a list into a tuple
# my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
# my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
# print(my_tuple)

# Write a
# Python program to create a tuple with multiple data types
# my_tuple = (25, "Apple", 3.14, True, "Python")
# print(my_tuple)

#Write a Python program to
# concatenate two tuples into one.
# tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
# tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
# result = tuple1 + tuple2
# print(result)

# Write a Python program to access the value of the first
# index in a tuple.

# my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# print(my_tuple[0])
